Dear <%=@user.firstname%>
<br><br>
Thank you for registering with Galactic Exchange.
<br><br>
Your ClusterGXâ„¢ account has been created and verified.
<br><br>
We sent an SMS message to the cell phone number you provided when registering.
The SMS provides your account username and password credentials.
You will need these account credentials as you add each node to your cluster.

<br><br>

If you are planning to run ClusterGX on Amazon Web Services (AWS), you can use ClusterGX from
a web browser anywhere in the world, or install our desktop client, which runs on Windows, Mac and Ubuntu.
The web browser version is faster start with, the desktop client provides more functionality, such as
integrated SSH into your cluster nodes.


<br><br>

You can log in into the browser version here : <%=Gexcore::Settings.hub_url%>
<br>
To install the desktop client, go here: <%=Gexcore::Settings.download_url%>


<br><br>
Once you log in into ClusterGX through either the web browser or desktop client ,
we will ask you for your AWS account access key and key id, so we can run ClusterGX in your AWS account.

<br><br>

In order to get a key id and a key do the following:

<ul>
  <li>
    Sign in to your AWS account at  https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose Users.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose the name of the desired user, and then choose the Security Credentials tab.
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to the Access Keys section
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose download credentials to save the access key ID and secret access key to a CSV file on your computer.
  </li>
</ul>

If you are in any trouble, read intructions here http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey

<br><br>

If you are planning to run ClusterGX on your own machines (on-premises), you will need to install our desktop client
on any laptop or desktop that will be used to manage the cluster.  Our desktop client is based on the same framework
as Slack and is really easy to use.

You can install the Desktop Client here : <%=Gexcore::Settings.download_url%>


<br><br>

You will then need to decide which machines will become nodes of the ClusterGX on-prem cluster.  If you want to run
the cluster on desktops, you need to install  ClusterGX desktop client on each desktop that will be part of the cluster.
You will then be able to enable it as cluster nodes. Desktop nodes can be used to quckly run ClusterGX on prem.

<br><br>
For a production level ClusterGX installation on-premises, you will need to install ClusterGX on bare metal servers.
Please contact us at  <%=Gexcore::Settings.support_email%> for an easy install bare metal installation image.
